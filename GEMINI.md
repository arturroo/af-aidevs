# AI_Devs Course Playground Context

This repository (`af-aidevs`) is the dedicated playground for the AI_Devs course. 

## Project-Specific Rules

### Naming Conventions (Google & DeepMind Best Practices)
To keep the structure scalable, readable, and perfectly sorted (just as we do at Google):

- **Lesson Directories:** We use a strict prefix followed by a kebab-case title.
  - Format: `S[Season]E[Episode]-[kebab-case-title]`
  - Example: `S01E01-programowanie-interakcji-z-modelem-jezykowym`
  - *Why?* This ensures alphabetical sorting perfectly matches chronological order, while keeping the context (the title) immediately visible without needing to open the folder to see what it's about.

- **Markdown Files:** The primary notes file inside the directory should simply be named `lesson.md` or `notes.md` to avoid redundant paths (like `S01E01-title/S01E01-title.md`), though keeping the downloaded markdown name as-is (e.g., `s01e01-programowanie...md`) is also perfectly fine if downloaded directly from the course platform.

### Infrastructure (Terraform)
- **Scope:** All Terraform code is centralized in the `/terraform` folder using standard Google Cloud Terraform module structures.
- **Provider:** We are using Google Provider `~> 7.0`.
- **State:** Remote backend state (GCS) will be configured in `backend.tf`. Service accounts (`*.json`) must NEVER be committed.
